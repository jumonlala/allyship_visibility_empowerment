# Reflection on Allyship, Visibility, and Empowerment

In Audre Lorde’s “The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action,” the author presents a powerful narrative that compels readers to reflect on the silences we maintain in our lives. Lorde's story resonated with me, particularly because I often feel that breaking silence is impossible in certain situations. Her writing prompted me to confront my fears—was it the judgment of others or the dismissal I had faced in the past? When she addressed the fear of visibility, I felt a deep echo within myself; my own fear of being seen by others has often kept me trapped in silence. The comfort I find in solitude, away from judgment, reveals the extent of this fear. This realization pains me, as I understand that overcoming my fear of visibility is crucial for fully embracing my identities. Additionally, I recognize that to be an effective ally and supporter of other oppressed groups, particularly those whose identities differ from my own, I must push through this fear and make my voice heard. Silence is not neutral—it upholds oppression, and breaking it is the first step in supporting others in their struggles.

In “Becoming an Ally,” Nancy J. Evans and Jamie Washington provide a nuanced understanding of allyship. They emphasize that allyship is most powerful when the ally is not part of the oppressed group, prompting me to reflect on my own approach to supporting marginalized communities. The authors discuss concepts such as unearned advantage and conferred dominance, helping me realize that allyship extends beyond simply believing in equality; it requires an acknowledgment that true equity has not yet been achieved. This revelation made me rethink my desire to support my LGBTQ+ friends. While I care deeply for them, I recognize that I haven’t always considered the broader systems of oppression that affect their lives. This reading taught me that allyship involves active awareness of how institutionalized policies and practices perpetuate oppression, demanding that I engage with societal structures, understand their impact, and challenge them openly.

Gloria E. Anzaldúa’s reflections in “Allies” focus on the destructive power of shame, particularly how it undermines a person's confidence and self-esteem. When shame takes hold, it disempowers individuals and erodes their sense of self-worth, diminishing their ability to trust their own judgments and values. Anzaldúa illustrates how internalized oppression can dismantle a person's identity, resonating with me as I consider how shame has influenced my fears, especially around visibility. She points out that when a person's sense of self is destroyed, it affects not only their ability to act but also their capacity to resist oppression. This understanding prompts me to confront my own shame and recognize its role as a silencing tool used against others, motivating me to work toward dismantling it wherever I encounter it.

In connecting these pieces, it becomes evident that breaking silence, understanding the structures of oppression, and resisting the disempowering force of shame are interconnected aspects of allyship and self-empowerment. To be a true ally, one must actively dismantle not only external systems of oppression but also the internalized barriers—such as fear and shame—that inhibit action. The insights from Lorde, Evans, Washington, and Anzaldúa inspire me to become more vocal, self-aware, and active in challenging both personal and systemic forces of oppression.
